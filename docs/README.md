# EVE User Guide

![ProductScreenshot.png](ProductScreenshot.png)

EVE is a **desktop chatbot application for managing your task schedule, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface**(CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI).

You can add tasks, deadlines and events to your schedule, just by telling EVE. You can also tell EVE to mark tasks as done and
remove tasks one by one or multiple at a time.

## Features

**Notes about command format:**

- words in uppercase are to be supplied by the user. E.g. in ```todo TASK```, ```TASK``` is the parameter which can be 
used as ```todo bake cupcakes```.

## Listing all tasks: ```list```

Shows a list of all the tasks in the list.

Format: ```list```

## Search: ```SEARCH```

Shows a list of all the tasks containing the ```SEARCH``` term. 

Note that:
- search is case-sensitive
- the order of keywords do not matter

Format: ```SEARCH``` (i.e. just key in the term you are searching for.)

Examples:
- ```baking``` returns 
- ```homework``` returns 

## Adding todos: ```todo```

Adds a task without any time restrictions to your task list. 

Format: ```todo TASK```

- ```todo bake cupcakes```
- ```todo go for a walk```
